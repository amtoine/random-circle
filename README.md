## install the dependencies
a good practice is to install the dependencies in a fresh `python` virtual environment,
to avoid messing around with the main system `python` installation!

once in the environment of your choice, issue the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## run the code
```bash
./main.py --help
```
